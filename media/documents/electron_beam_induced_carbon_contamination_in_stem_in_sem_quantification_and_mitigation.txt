Electron-beam-induced carbon contamination is a detrimental side effect in almost all electron microscopy investigations.
The growth of contamination is unwanted because it covers structures of interest, worsens the resolution, and may cause charging problems (Heide, 1963; Egerton, 2019).
It also impedes analytical studies by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy that require high current densities. Contamination results
from electron-beam-induced polymerization of carbon-rich organic molecules on the sample surface (mobile contaminants) that are present from sample preparation and storage or
adsorption of molecules from the residual gas atmosphere in the microscope (Hillier, 1948; Heide, 1963; Egerton & Rossouw, 1976; Knox, 1976; Love et al., 1981; Reimer, 1998; Li & Joy, 2006).
The contamination deposit is amorphous and carbonaceous but may contain other elements, like hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen (Hillier, 1948; Kumao et al., 1981; Reimer, 1998; Lau et al., 2010;
Hettler et al., 2017). If a thin sample is irradiated by the electron beam, the deposit grows on both sides of the film (Hren, 1978).

A distinction must be made between contamination induced by three types of illumination: Illumination by a defocused stationary electron beam denoted as transmission
 electron microscopy (TEM)-like illumination in the following, illumination by a scanning focused beam denoted as scanning-(transmission)-electron-microscopy (S(T)EM)-like
  illumination, and illumination by a stationary focused electron beam (spot illumination). Different contamination morphologies typically result from different illumination
   strategies. For spot illumination, cones are formed (Conru & Laberge, 1975; Kanaya et al., 1990). Kanaya et al. and others described a transition from a cone to a circular frame-like
    morphology with increasing contamination thickness at the boundary of the illuminated region for an increasing beam diameter, depending on the relation between the spot radius and
     the diffusion coefficient (Hren, 1978; Kanaya et al., 1988). A large beam diameter frequently leads to circular, frame-like contamination patterns in TEM. For a focused scanning
      beam as in S(T)EM, the shape of the deposit typically follows the dimensions of the scanned area (Hirsch et al., 1994; Roediger et al., 2009). Its thickness is often more homogeneous
       than contamination from irradiating a region of the same size with a static beam, which was explained by the replenishment of hydrocarbons during the scan refresh time (Utke et al., 2008).
        However, amplified contamination growth at the border of the scanned region is also observed (Hirsch et al., 1994; Vladár et al., 2001, 2008; Vladár & Postek, 2005; Griffiths & Walther,
         2010; Lau et al., 2010; Wanzenboeck et al., 2010).

Contamination research has been performed since the early studies of Stewart, Watson, and Ennos, and many other publications have
 shed light on different factors of carbon contamination (Stewart, 1934; Watson, 1947; Ennos, 1953). However, only a smaller fraction
  of the work is related to quantitative contamination studies. For example, Hirsch et al. (1994) have systematically evaluated contamination
   growth in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) on bulk samples. They determined relative contamination thicknesses by recording backscattered
    electron (BSE)-SEM images that were normalized with the BSE intensity of clean sample regions. Roediger et al. (2009) investigated the absolute
     thickness of deposits produced by SEM irradiation on bulk Si by atomic force microscopy. Energy-filtered TEM was used for quantification of the
     contamination thickness by Mitchell who tested contamination growth on carbon films and other specimens at 200 keV in the STEM mode (Mitchell, 2015).
