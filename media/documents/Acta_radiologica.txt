In total, 24 rabbits were studied as four groups of six animals. Group 1 served as the control group. In group 2, transient ischemia was obtained by intracarotid administration of degradable starch microspheres (DSM). Group 3 was administered thiopental intra-arterially via the carotid artery. Group 4 (experimental group) received both thiopental and DSM intra-arterially. DSM and thiopental were administered through a microcatheter placed into the common carotid artery via the central ear artery access. After sacrifice, apoptotic cells in the cerebral tissues of the animals were evaluated in H&E and TUNEL stained slides.
