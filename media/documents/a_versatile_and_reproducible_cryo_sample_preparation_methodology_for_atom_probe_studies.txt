Atom probe tomography (APT) offers a unique combination of high spatial resolution and elemental sensitivity
in the atomic part-per-million range, to provide three-dimensional analysis of the distribution of atoms in
a material (Gault et al., 2021; Lim et al., 2020; De Geuser & Gault, 2020; Devaraj et al., 2018). The overall
process involves generating high electric fields at the end of a needle-shaped specimen, typically <100â€…nm in diameter,
that cause the joint ionization and desorption of atoms from the surface, triggered by either laser or voltage pulses
(Gault et al., 2006; Hono et al., 2011). These needle-shaped specimens are routinely prepared using dual-beam scanning
electron microscopes-focused ion beams (SEM-FIB) (Thompson et al., 2007; Prosa & Larson, 2017). However, the FIB-based
preparation of beam-sensitive materials or liquid samples remains challenging (Schreiber et al., 2018; Bassim et al., 2012).
Cryogenic freezing can preserve the sample's structure and composition, enabling high-quality analysis while minimizing
    FIB milling-induced damage (McCarroll et al., 2020; El-Zoka et al., 2020; Rivas et al., 2020). The development of
    cryogenic stages for the SEM-FIBs has enabled the analysis of a wider range of materials using APT, and cryogenic
    shuttle systems allow for the transfer of specimens between instruments, enabling APT analysis of materials that
are sensitive to air or change in temperatures (Gerstl & Wepf, 2015; Perea et al., 2017; Stephenson et al., 2018).
